# PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

### The purpose of this analysis was to study ride sharing data to help understand rides and fairs in categories of different types of cities.  Using Python and Jupyterlab, I created visualizations of assortments of rideshare data to help improve ride sharing for different types of neighborhoods.  

## Results

Using the statistical data, we can determine the following findings:
- Suburban cities pull in over 4.5 times the revenue compared to the other cities.
- Rural cities pay an average of $10 more than riders in urban cities. 
- The average fare per driver is $55 in rural cities, while the urban cities only average closer to $17.

## Summary 
In closing, I would recommend some business recommendations to Pyber based on the data we discovered.  
- Considering the discrepancy in earnings rural cities compared to urban cities, encourage a possible raise in price for drivers working in urban cities.
- Increase the number of drivers in rural areas to meet the demand of rides.
- The costs for Pyber is much higher amongst riders in the rural areas in comparison to urban cities, to combat this, I encourage lowering the price in rural cities to attract potential riders who do not use simply based off price.
